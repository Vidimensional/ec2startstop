# EC2 start stop

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Simple tool to start & stop an EC2 instance.

## Why

I have a couple of EC2 instances that I use from time to time to play arround.
I just wanted a simple way to start and stop them when I need to(and not having
to log into AWS console each time).

Also I wanted to play arround with Python and boto3.
